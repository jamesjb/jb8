# The JB-8 Computer Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamesjb/jb8.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesjb/jb8)

This is a simple 8-bit homebrew computer project. The
cross-development tools are being developed in Rust. Once
the system is bootstrapped, the native language will likely
be some type of direct-threaded fast interpreter for a
statically typed Lisp variant. Watch this space for more.

Currently work is in progress on a 6809 CPU core.
